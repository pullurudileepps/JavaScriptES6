Detailed Revision Notes: Functional Programming in JavaScript
Functional Programming with JavaScript Higher Order Functions
Introduction to Higher Order Functions
Higher Order Functions (HOFs) are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their result. The most common HOFs in JavaScript include: map, filter, and reduce.

Agenda for the Lesson
Understanding Polyfills: Writing JavaScript code that provides modern functionality on older browsers which do not support those features natively.
Creating Polyfills for HOFs: Implementing custom versions of map, filter, and reduce.
Interview Problem Solving: Tackling commonly asked interview problems using HOFs.
Polyfills for Map, Filter, and Reduce
Map Function Polyfill
Purpose: Creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
Implementation Steps:
Iterate over each element of the array with a for loop.
Apply the given function to each element and store it in the new array.
Return the new array containing the transformed elements【4:14†typed.md】.
Filter Function Polyfill
Purpose: Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
Key Concepts:
Initiate an empty results array.
Iterate through each element, applying a test function. If true, add the element to the results.
Return the results array.
Code Example:
if (!Array.prototype.myFilter) {
  Array.prototype.myFilter = function(callback, thisArg) {
    var result = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
      if (i in this) {
        if (callback.call(thisArg, this[i], i, this)) {
          result.push(this[i]);
        }
      }
    }
    return result;
  };
}

Reduce Function Polyfill
Purpose: Executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
Implementation Steps:
Initialize an accumulator to the initial value or the first element.
Iterate through each element, updating the accumulator based on the reducer function.
Return the accumulator which houses the final result【4:14†typed.md】.
Task: Manipulate Transaction Data with Reduce
Problem Statement
Given an array of transactions, develop a JavaScript function using HOF to transform and summarize data regarding transactions:

totalTransactions: Compute total number of transactions.
totalAmount: Sum of all transaction amounts.
averageTransactionAmount: Average transaction amount.
transactionsPerDay: Group transactions by date.
transactionsByCustomer: Group transactions by customer ID【4:3†transcript.txt】【4:10†typed.md】【4:14†typed.md】【4:16†transcript.txt】.
Solution Steps
Summarizing Transaction Data:

Total Transactions:
const totalTransactions = transactions.length;
Total Amount:
const totalAmount = transactions.reduce((total, transaction) => total + transaction.amount, 0);
Average Transaction Amount:
const averageTransactionAmount = totalAmount / totalTransactions;
Transactions Per Day: Using reduce to group transactions by their date property【4:3†typed.txt】.
Transactions By Customer: Similar to step 4, but grouped by the customerId【4:15†typed.md】.
Problem Solving with Functional Techniques
Flatten Nested Arrays: Transform a nested array into a single-dimensional array using recursive techniques and the spread operator within a reduce function【4:11†transcript.txt】.
Key Takeaways
HOFs like map, filter, and reduce provide a powerful way to abstract and handle data transformations in JavaScript through functional programming techniques.
Writing polyfills reinforces understanding of native JavaScript methods and can enhance coding fluency and readiness for interviews【4:13†transcript.txt】【4:17†transcript.txt】.
