Revision Notes for Software Engineering Class
Agenda of the Class
The class primarily focused on two significant JavaScript concepts—Event Delegation and creating Nested Comments. These topics are crucial for efficiently managing DOM interactions and implementing complex features in web applications.

Key Concepts Covered
1. Event Delegation
Event delegation is a powerful JavaScript pattern that optimizes handling events, particularly in scenarios involving dynamically created elements. It's based on two key ideas:

Event Bubbling: When an event occurs on a target element, it bubbles up to its parent elements. This behavior allows you to attach a single event listener to a parent element to manage all events that bubble up from its children.

Performance Optimization: By setting an event listener on a common ancestor rather than individual elements, you reduce the overhead associated with attaching multiple listeners.

Use Case Example
Consider a product listing page where each product has an "Add to Cart" button. Instead of setting click event listeners on each button, attach a single listener to the list's container. When a button is clicked, the listener identifies the target and processes the event accordingly【4:12†transcript.txt】【4:2†transcript.txt】.

Code Implementation:

const categoriesContainer = document.getElementById("categories");

categoriesContainer.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  const clickedElement = event.target;

  if (clickedElement.classList.contains("product")) {
    const category = clickedElement.closest(".category").querySelector("h2").textContent;
    console.log(`Clicked on ${clickedElement.textContent} in the ${category} category.`);
  }
});
2. Nested Comments
Nested comments are comments within comments, often seen in forums or discussion threads in platforms like Reddit or initial versions of Facebook.

Building a Nested Comment System
Structure: Use a combination of div, span, textarea, and buttons within containers to format how comments and replies appear.
Dynamism through CreateElement: Create a utility function to generate HTML elements dynamically, streamlining how new elements like comments are added.
Steps:

Create Function: Develop a utility function, createElement, that simplifies the creation and appending of HTML elements to the DOM.

Append Mechanism: Use the appendChild method to nest comments under parent comments, allowing a hierarchy to be visible【4:1†transcript.txt】【4:13†transcript.txt】.

Event Listeners: Implement click events for actions like "post comment" or "reply" using event delegation for efficient handling【4:11†transcript.txt】.

Code Implementation:

function createCommentElement(name, text) {
  const commentElement = document.createElement('div');
  commentElement.className = 'comment';

  const nameElement = document.createElement('p');
  nameElement.textContent = name;
  commentElement.appendChild(nameElement);

  const textElement = document.createElement('p');
  textElement.textContent = text;
  commentElement.appendChild(textElement);

  const replyButton = document.createElement('button');
  replyButton.textContent = 'Reply';
  commentElement.appendChild(replyButton);

  return commentElement;
}

function addNestedComment(name, text, parentElement) {
  const newComment = createCommentElement(name, text);
  parentElement.appendChild(newComment);
}
3. Event-Driven UI Interactivity
