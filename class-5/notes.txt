Detailed Revision Notes: Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript
Introduction to Asynchronous Programming
In JavaScript, asynchronous programming is vital for operations that require waiting for some time, like file reading, network requests, etc., without freezing the application. This session covered several key concepts and examples to illustrate the working of asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

Synchronous vs Asynchronous Programming
Synchronous Programming
Synchronous code execution is blocking, meaning that operations are executed sequentially. For example, reading a file synchronously will block further code execution until the operation completes:

const fs = require("fs");

console.log('Before'); // This will be printed first

let data1 = fs.readFileSync('f1.txt'); // The execution is blocked until the file is read

console.log('This is File 1 data -> ' + data1); // This is printed after the file is read
In this code, further operations will not proceed until the file reading is complete .

Asynchronous Programming
In contrast, asynchronous code execution does not block sequential flows, allowing further code to execute while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete. This is useful for tasks like reading files or making network requests without freezing the program.

fs.readFile('f1.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('This is File 1 data -> ' + data);
});

console.log('After');
Here, console.log('After') will execute before the file read operation completes due to its non-blocking nature .

Asynchronous Methods and the Event Loop
SetTimeout Example
setTimeout is a native asynchronous function in JavaScript, used to execute a function after a specified number of milliseconds:

console.log("Start");

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Hello");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
Output:

Start
End
Hello (after 2 seconds)
Here, "Hello" is printed after a 2-second delay because setTimeout queues the callback function to execute after the delay expires. Meanwhile, the rest of the code continues to run .

Callbacks
Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, which can then be executed after the completion of an asynchronous task. Nested callback functions can lead to callback hell, where multiple callbacks nest inside each other complicating the code.

function cb1(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log("The File data ->" + data);
  fs.readFile("f2.txt", cb2);
}

// Further callbacks cb2 and cb3
Using callbacks for reading files sequentially means using a callback within a callback, maintaining the read order .

The Event Loop
The event loop is a mechanism that enables non-blocking I/O operations. It allows JavaScript to perform tasks asynchronously, handling operations like reading files or making HTTP requests while performing other operations.

JavaScript Asynchronous Operations in Node.js
In Node.js, the fs module provides both synchronous and asynchronous file operations. Here is a comparison:

Synchronous: fs.readFileSync blocks execution until a file read completes.
Asynchronous: fs.readFile allows code execution to continue, using a callback function once the file read finishes .
Key Components Explained
Call Stack: Keeps track of function calls. It can only execute one operation at a time.
Web/Node APIs: Browser or Node environments that handle asynchronous operations.
Callback Queue: Holds functions waiting to be executed after their corresponding asynchronous operations.
Event Loop: Continuously checks if the call stack is empty and moves operations from the callback queue to the call stack .
